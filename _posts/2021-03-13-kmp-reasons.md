В сообществе [MobileNativeFoundation](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation) Представитель Touchlab [рассказал их наблюдения о том почему компании выбирают Kotlin Multiplatform](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/43#discussioncomment-476363).

> Here's a selection of some reasons I've heard for choosing Kotlin Multiplatform as a native code sharing solution vs a cross-platform solution
> 
> * Must have strong offline capabilities
> * Heavy reliance on device sensors
> * Been burned by choosing cordova/react-native/xamarin in the past
> * Don't want to reskill the team
> * Want to focus on sharing business logic and don't want to retool UIs
> * Maximizing the the value of code sharing is better than maximizing the amount of code sharing
> * The risk of making the wrong choice (backing out of KMP can keep Android app, backing out of others means starting over)
> * See the value of native UI for optimal customer experience
> * Retain great devs who see the value in learning and using Swift, SwiftUI, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose
> * Apple's mobile investments and Google's Android investments are a more stable bet than Google's Flutter and other 3rd party solutions
> * Don't want to introduce a 3rd platform (still need native devs with other solutions)
> * Can use innovations from Apple and Google as soon as appropriate rather than waiting on 3rd party or community
> * Current library choices don't have equivalents in other solutions, are less maintained, featureful, or would require taking on the work of making them work

А также на сайте [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) в разделе [Case Studies](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/case-studies/) можно прочитать детально о опыте использованя технологии в разных компаниях. Уже сейчас там есть компании VMWare, Autodesk, Yandex, Square, Philips, Netflix и другие, включая и нас, IceRock.
